This script helps you download all repositories for deep leanring potential using deepmd-kit.

Make a folder for your study, and the put this script into this folder.
Perl deepMD_all.pl

The following folders you will get:
1. QE_from_MatCld: structures from materials project
2. make_B2_related_data: make your strutures with different compositional fractions.
3. make_surface_20240919: make surfaces with different surface orientations and different compositional fractions.

4. dp_train_new: get DLP for labeling or final DLPã€€training  
5. dp_train_label: do dpgen
